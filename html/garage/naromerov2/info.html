			<h1>Get to know me.</h1>
			<h2>Who is this guy anyway?</h2>
			<p>Well, I'm sure that by now you've figured that I am Nathan Romero. I'm a 6'4", brown haired, hazel-eyed graphic designer based out of San Francisco, CA. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and have jumped into employment rather quickly since graduation. Despite enduring four tenuous years at the university, I have come to terms with the fact that I probably will not pursue a career in the cognitive science field. Instead, I have been fortunate enough to find a full-time career right out of college in something I am truly passionate for--graphic design.</p>
			<p>This career decision wasn’t by any means rash because truthfully, design has been a hobby of mine since I was a freshman in high school. It wasn't until I landed a job at a design studio my junior year of college that I considered turning my hobby into a viable career choice. At this studio I was given the opportunity to design something new everyday and picked up design theory along the way. Given the amount of high-exposure projects I designed, I really began to hone my skills has a graphic designer. My designs were seen by a large student body and I regard my time at this design studio as some of the most transformative years of my life.</p>
			<h2>Tell me something interesting. Hobbies?</h2>
			<p>As far as hobbies go, the list is pretty short at the moment. I began my employment only 3 days after my last final and a lot of my free time now is spent "settling-in". Graphic design was usually what I did with my free time--after homework was done and tests were studied for, of course. Now that midterms are a thing of the past and my “9-5” is spent designing, I'm left with a lot of free time. During these hours, you can probably find me reading up on HTML/CSS, spending time with my girlfriend, or at a local card room taking some sucker’s money.</p>
