            <h2>Finding a garage sale is tough,</h2>
            <p class="cols">
                finding one that you actually want to check out is even more difficult. I chose this prompt because as far as garage sale discovery goes, there’s not much out there. Finding garage sales at this point in time is confined to browsing craigslist ads or driving around your neighborhood on the weekend. I designed out this experience with two users in mind. The first, which I just briefly alluded to, is the spontaneous, "Hey, let's check out this garage sale" type of user. This user needs information on garage sales near them and they need it fast. The second type of user takes a much more methodical approach to garage sale hunting. This user is a meticulous planner and spends their week researching where they want to go on the weekend. Within this experience are considerations for each type of user. Information about sales near you can be accessed quickly, while simultaneously allowing your well-read and researched user to map out their weekend of sale hunting.

                Using a smart phone, garage sellers have everything they need to create an informative listing built into their device. As far as the UI goes, the creation of garage sales is a similar experience to that of browsing sales. Many of the now familiar UI patterns are repeated here and irrelevant information and actions are replaced with more relevant content and UI.
